# ISH (Insurance System for Health)

## Project Overview
ISH (Insurance System for Health) is a fully integrated online platform that allows citizens to apply for various health and insurance plans tailored to their life situations and profiles. The system evaluates citizens' eligibility based on their provided information, enabling a more efficient and streamlined application process.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Java, J2EE, Spring Boot, Microservices
- **Microservices Architecture**: Config Server, Eureka Server, API Gateway, Admin Server
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Cloud**: AWS for infrastructure management
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Testing**: JUnit for unit testing
- **API Documentation & Testing**: Swagger, Postman

## Key Features
- Citizens can apply for health and insurance plans online.
- The system determines eligibility based on user-provided data.
- Approved citizens are provided with monthly benefits based on their selected plans.

## Government Schemes Covered
- **SNAP**: A food assistance program for low-income individuals.
- **CCAP**: A childcare assistance program for low-income families.
- **Medicaid**: A health insurance plan for citizens with limited income and resources.
- **Medicare**: Health insurance for citizens over 65 years old.
- **QHP**: A commercial health insurance plan that citizens can purchase.

## Microservices Architecture
1. **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management for microservices.
2. **Eureka Server**: Service registry for discovering and registering microservices.
3. **API Gateway**: Manages routing for microservices, providing a unified entry point for clients.
4. **Admin Server**: Monitors and manages the various microservices, including health checks and application status.

## API Development
- **RESTful APIs**: A comprehensive set of RESTful APIs were developed to manage user authentication, profile management, application submissions, eligibility determination, and more.
- **Swagger**: Used for API documentation, providing an interactive interface for testing APIs.
- **Postman**: Extensively used to test API endpoints, validate responses, and simulate client-server interactions.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Docker
- AWS Account (for deployment)
- MySQL (for database)

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/boiniraj/Insurance-System-for-Health.git
